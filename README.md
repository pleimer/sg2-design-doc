# SG2 Design Doc

Here lies a design document outlaying a plugin architectural approach to Smart Gateway 2 (don't worry, it is not dead, yet). Additionally, some open source solutions are explored in the context of Service Telemetry Operator with mentions of what the solution currently satisfies, the changes that would need to be made to STO to implement this solution and what areas the team may need to implement. A ROI assessment between implementing a pluggable engine and adapting are project to an open source solution can help us roadmap what steps should come next.
